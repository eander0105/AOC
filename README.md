# Advent of Code

## 2024

### Introduction

This year, I decided to learn more about Go (Golang). Hopefully, by the end of this journey, I will be able to look back at my initial code and see significant improvements.

### Goals

- Learn Go programming language
- Solve Advent of Code challenges
- Improve coding skills over time

### Progress

I will document my progress and solutions here as I work through the challenges.
